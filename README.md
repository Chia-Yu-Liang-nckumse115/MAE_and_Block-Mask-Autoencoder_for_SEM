While updating my CV today, I suddenly thought about my past MAE work and impulsively tried training it on SEM outputs. I’m not even sure what the final results will be good for, but I figured I’d just do it anyway and record the process.
So I did some more research, searched some more informations on the internet( of course ChatGpt), and tried to figure out how the trained model could be applied. Here’s what I’ve got so far:

1. Autoencoders have this special property: they learn normal patterns well but do a terrible job reconstructing abnormal areas (cuz basically we trained the model expecting it to predict the structure that's most possibly to happen). So regions with high reconstruction error during testing could correspond to defects—like pores, cracks, special intergranular phases, deposition anomalies, contamination, or unusual grain boundaries.

2. Still brainstorming, I will add more when I think of something.

By the way, trained by only 32 images. From my prospectine the result is lowkey promosing. Don't be too demanding.

But i'll still try to improve it!!!!
